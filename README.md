recommenders-sample
===================

This is a small demo showing how to run Code Recommenders call recommender in a headless environment. This project is a snapshot for the headless API we are going to build for Code Recommenders 2.0 but all API is unstable. The main development is happening at http://eclipse.org/recommenders/.


To run a very basic example, execute the main method in /org.eclipse.recommenders.calls/src/org/eclipse/recommenders/calls/CallsRecommender.java
